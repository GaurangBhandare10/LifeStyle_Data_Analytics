# LifeStyle_Data_Analytics
This project focuses on Lifestyle Analytics, using fitness, nutrition, and behavioral data to study how daily habits impact health. From a DWBI perspective, lifestyle data is multi-dimensional and metric-heavy, making it ideal for transformation into structured, decision-ready insights through an end-to-end BI solution.
